# Documentation assets

This folder contains documentation assets.  

It includes the `demo` folder, which provides examples of inputs and outputs. 

The actual documentation is generated through a [GitHub workflow](../.github/workflows/deployDocs.yml) and is available at [https://shubhvjain.github.io/dlonweb/](https://shubhvjain.github.io/dlonweb/).

The source code for the documentation is in the `core` folder and is generated automatically using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).

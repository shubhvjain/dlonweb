# The `DL.web.js.core` package 


This sub-repository contains the implementation of the core classes of the project. 

This includes 3 classes : `InferenceTask` , `Data` and `Library`

This packages is essentially dependency free and only contains the logic part. It expects the dependency to be provided at the time of instantiation (i.e via dependency injection). This makes it flexible to be used in a backend as well as a frontend project. 

## Installation 

Currently this packages can only be installed locally. In the other sub-repos this is already installed in this manner

### Step of local installation 
- Clone the repo
- Then head to the root of the project where you want to install it and run `npm run 'local-path-to-the-package'`

#TODO : Publish the core package on `npm`
